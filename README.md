a few scripts uploaded here to help you get started with MQTT to Unity

examples of scripts I used for my project
-arduino code sets up the MQTT topic for three MPU sensors
-assets/scripts: several scripts used for AI words to clone flying TMP objects and copy them to another clone imprint TMP
-assets/plugins: MQTTnet is the tool to incorporate a broker receiver. put that dll file in assets/plugins folder.

use huggingface sentis/whisper-tiny to get started with a model using Sentis 2.0+

let me know if you find this and are struggling.
